# Game Tracker Demo

This project was developed over 2 evenings in order to demonstrate my capabilities with React-based technologies and code cleanliness. Below are the technologies utilized in this project:

- React v17
- React Router
- Redux (State Management)
- TypeScript (Typed Language)
- Styled Components (CSS3 + React)
- ESLint/Prettier (Code Cleanliness)

The app consists of **Login** and **Summary** pages. To login, refer to the account credentials provided u nder [src/database/entities.json](src/database/entities.json).

## Highlights

- Follow Brad Frost's Atomic Design Pattern for component structure.
- State management handled by Redux.
  - Mock user session
  - Mock API calls to retrieve entity and game collection data
  - Skeleton Loaders for individual components
- Mobile Responsive
